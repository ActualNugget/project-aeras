## Introduction

Aeras, meaning "air" in Greek, represents the project's core focus on climate control optimization in carparks. Efficiently managing the climate control system in a carpark plays a vital role in ensuring a comfortable and energy-efficient environment. The Aeras project integrates occupancy estimation techniques with a lift system to provide an optimized climate control setting based on real-time occupancy data.

By accurately estimating the occupancy levels of vehicles and people at each carpark level, Aeras aims to make informed decisions regarding climate control settings. The project takes into account the lift system's movement, adjusting the occupancy data accordingly to provide a comprehensive analysis for optimized climate control.

## Features

- Real-time Occupancy Estimation: Aeras employs occupancy sensors strategically placed throughout the carpark to collect data on vehicle and people presence at each level. By processing this data, Aeras provides accurate real-time occupancy estimations.

- Lift System Integration: Aeras incorporates a lift system that facilitates the movement of people between different levels of the office. The prototype model adjusts the occupancy data based on the lift activity, ensuring accurate estimations.

- Climate Control Optimization: The core objective of Aeras is to optimize the climate control settings in the carpark based on the real-time occupancy data. By analyzing occupancy patterns and trends, the system determines the optimal temperature, ventilation, and other climate control parameters for each carpark level.

- Visualization and Reporting: Aeras provides visualizations and reports that depict occupancy levels, lift activity, and climate control settings. These insights aid in evaluating the effectiveness of the optimization strategies and enable informed decision-making.

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Python
- Web Framework: Flask
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Raspberry Pi: Integration of occupancy sensors and lift system control
